Hello, my name is Jacob Bearden. I am a programmer who likes web development,
the internet, and music. I enjoy scratching my own itch and writing about my
various endeavours in programming and other miscellaneous activities.

I am currently living and working in Boise as a Designer for a print shop,
where I create and enhance print designs for local sports teams.

I spend my free time [writing code](//github.com/jacobbearden), listening to
music, and [tweeting](//twitter.com/jacobbearden_).

Feel free to take a look at my [résumé](//dropbox.com/s/6hq5dtzmso9joyo/resume.pdf)
or [get in touch](mailto:jacob@bearden.io).
