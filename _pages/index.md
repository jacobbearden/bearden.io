Hello, my name is Jacob Bearden. I am a programmer who likes web development, the internet, music, and Super Smash Brothers.

I'm currently living and working in Boise, Idaho for a printshop, where I help create and enhance designs for t-shirts and athletic jerseys.

I spend my free time [writing code](//github.com/jacobbearden), listening to music, and [tweeting](//twitter.com/jacobbearden_).
