Hello, my name is Jacob Bearden. I am a programmer who likes web development, the internet, and music. I enjoy scratching my own itch and writing about my various endeavours in programming and other miscellaneous activities.

I am currently living and working in Boise for a printshop, where I create and enhance print designs for local sports teams.

I spend my free time [writing code](//github.com/jacobbearden), listening to music, and [tweeting](//twitter.com/jacobbearden_).
