title: Fixing My Wii
---

Back in 2006, when the Nintendo Wii was the next big thing, my family got one. For years my siblings and I played on it all the time, playing games ranging from Cooking Mama to Guitar Hero. But one day, in 2011 or 2012 if my memory serves me well, it stopped working. It wouldn't recognize disks anymore. We were upset, but because we couldn't afford a new one, it was banished to the back of a closet. Not to be played for years.

Recently, after taking an interest in competitive Super Smash Brothers, I remembered the Wii. I dug it out of the back of the closet and started investigating what was wrong. After some Googling and reading various articles and forum posts it was my best guess that the disk lens had gotten dirty.

Not wanting to spend money on a lens cleaning kit I decided to take matters in to my own hands. Using a small piece of cardboard (from a cereal box I might add), tape, a DVD, and a band-aid, I assembled my own disk cleaner:

Yes, that was my disk cleaner I macgyvered together. The idea was that I'd slide the device in to the disk drive of the Wii, and use the cardboard extending off the back to move it back and forth, ensuring the band-aid wiped off the lens.

Much to my surprise, it worked perfectly! The Wii recognized the Gamecube game I had put in the drive!
