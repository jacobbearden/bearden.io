title: Using &lt;details&gt; on GitHub
---

I discovered a feature on [GitHub](//github.com) recently, suppose you're going to open an issue and you want to include a bunch of messy logs.

Rather than just pasting them in, use the `<details>` tag!

```html
<details>
	<summary>Logs</summary>
	...
</details>
```

It will end up looking like:

<details>
	<summary>Logs</summary>
	...
</details>
