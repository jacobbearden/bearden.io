Hello, my name is Jacob Bearden. I am a programmer with a penchant for web development, the internet, music, and Super Smash Brothers. I also enjoy writing about my various endeavors.

I am currently living and working in Boise, Idaho.

I spend my free time [writing code](//github.com/jacobbearden), listening to music, and [tweeting](//twitter.com/jacobbearden_).

Feel free to take a look at my [résumé](//jacobbearden.keybase.pub/resume.pdf) or [get in touch](mailto:jacob@bearden.io).
